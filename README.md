## What is BeatOps?

BeatOps is a desktop app built for type beat producers who want to spend less time on uploads and more time making music. It automates the entire upload workflow: audio analysis (BPM, key detection), video creation with visualizers, thumbnail generation, SEO-optimized metadata via templates, and multi-platform distribution.

Everything runs locally on your computer. Your beats never leave your machine until you explicitly upload them. BeatOps handles the tedious parts so you can focus on production.
