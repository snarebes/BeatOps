## What is BeatOps?

BeatOps is a desktop app built for type beat producers who want to spend less time on admin and more time making music. It handles the entire workflow: audio analysis, thumbnail generation, video creation, SEO-optimized metadata, multi-platform uploads, analytics, and production tracking.

Everything runs locally on your computer. Your beats never leave your machine until you explicitly upload them.

## Upload everywhere from one place

Fill in your beat info, select your platforms, and hit Process & Upload. BeatOps handles metadata, images, videos, and distribution in one go.
